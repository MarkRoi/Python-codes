"@Tintin32869836 @nyanzi_music @Winnie_Byanyima Anyways, you are free to do whatever you want..its your choice leave religion out of it. We won't change our scriptures or rules to suit a particular audience. If its a sin in a particular religion, you are free to change a religion or start up one that supports your agenda."
@Tintin32869836 @nyanzi_music @Winnie_Byanyima Anything can be put on Google to suit a particular audience.
"@Tintin32869836 @nyanzi_music @Winnie_Byanyima And even of Paul was writing letters, do you thing those people who wrote all those books that make up a bible just woke up and started writing whatever they wanted?

"@AnnonKitsch @Winnie_Byanyima Whenever a person doesn't agree to your acts you label him/her a homophobe.  Your community only wants to sit with people who agree with them that's why in America, anyone who disagrees is sacked and called homophobic because he/she has no right to challenge that community."
